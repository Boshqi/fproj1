<h1>The ones that play with fire</h1>
<p>The children played in the fields, enjoying themselves amongst the grassy terrain under the clear blue sky.
    The fresh scent of flowers blooming swept through the air. A windy day it was. They were ignorant of tomorrow,
    the scenery indulging them in a bliss that nature can only bring. As they froliced along, they became rather 
    tired, and decided to sleep among the nearby trees. The trees stood tall up on the cliff. They towered over the
    field, giant creatures to the children. They did not fear these tall statues and rested below their evergreen leaves.
    Once the children had rested from their nap, they again went back into the field to play. They all were inseparable.
    Yet there were individuals living among themselves. They didn't know any better when the skies were turning a redish-orange,
    seemingly a sunsetting from their time spent together. Oh how the time has gone. A glow would soon appear among the grassy 
    fields. The smell of flowers no longer breezing through the air, but smoke clouding the fields. It was 
    exhilerating! To be thrust into a new environment without having moved far. The children were ecstatic to experience such
    an event. They enjoyed themselves even more amongst the once grassy terrain, now mixed in with small flames of bright orange.
    One of the children however, had realized what had happened. They looked at the others, crying for them to stop playing. They 
    continued. "What is there to be afraid of? Why won't you join us?", one of them spoke. The lone child said "It's too dangerous,
    we should run away from here." The other child, feeling confused, then angered said "Why? What is the flame going to do to us? we
     are perfectly fine. We are all having fun playing in this vibrant field. Come join us." The lone child argued back saying "You should 
     get away from here. It's getting too dangerous." The other child had a different look on their face. A cold-hearted look of shame and 
     disappointment. They jestered a shrug and left the lonely child, running back in to the field where the other friends were having the 
     most fun that they ever had experienced. What once was a colorful field slowly turned gray, the giant trees that stood tall had 
     disappeared. No more shelter for the children to rest. They were all grown up.
